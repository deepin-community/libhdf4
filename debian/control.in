Description: Hierarchical Data Format library (embedded NetCDF)
 HDF is a multi-object file format for storing and transferring
 graphical and numerical data mainly used in scientific computing. HDF
 supports several different data models, including multidimensional
 arrays, raster images, and tables. Each defines a specific aggregate
 data type and provides an API for reading, writing, and organizing the
 data and metadata. New data models can be added by the HDF developers
 or users.
 .
 This package contains the HDF run-time libraries.
