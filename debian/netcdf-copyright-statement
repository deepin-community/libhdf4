In March 1996, I changed netCDF licensing to replace the obligation to
credit UCAR/Unidata in products or publications that made use of netCDF,
after email discussion with Richard Stallman convinced me that the
original language caused a problem.  We also announced the licensing
change on our "What's new with netCDF" web page in April 1996, as
recorded here:

  http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/whatsnew.html

where we also credit Stallman for suggesting the change.

As head of the group that develops and maintains netCDF software, I'm
happy to retroactively relicense the netCDF software released before
April 1996 to use the copyright conditions under which netCDF software
has been subsequently licensed:

If you need anything more official, please let us know.
