libhdf4 (4.2r4-2) experimental; urgency=low

   An upstream unsupported shared edition with mixed C and Fortran functions
   are now provided. Note that the upstream SONAME is maintained, but
   the shlibs are not ABI compatible with upstream or third parties
   editions. This should not be a true problem, because HDF4 libraries
   were provided in static mode traditionally until very recent versions.

libhdf4 (4.2r4-1) experimental; urgency=low

   The HDF4 libraries are now supported as shared libraries by upstream.
   Unfortunately that support does not include the Fortran API, which
   has been dropped in Debian packages. This differs from previous
   shlib mixed mode C/Fortran distributed packages, which were a Debian
   specific extension. In short terms, if you need the Fortran API you
   have now to build the static libraries yourself and include them with
   your application.

   A different (-alt aka alternative) flavor of the two HDF4 libraries
   is also provided to be compatible with an external NetCDF library and
   allow linking both NetCDF and HDF4 libraries within the same program.
   In order to use the alternative flavor you have to use -lmfhdfalt
   and -ldfalt instead of the usual -lmfhdf and -ldf linking items. The
   standard flavor is totally back-compatible and provides embedded a
   partial NetCDF support. 
   
   See README.Debian for major information about that.
